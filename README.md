# TypeScript + Node POC

This is a project for me to learn about the interaction between Node.js and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

A lot of the configuration for this app has been referenced from [microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter), but I am keeping it as simple as possible.

1. Install dependencies
```shell
npm i
```
2. Run the server in Dev Mode
```shell
npm run watch
```
3. Make sure it's working by going to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. You should see `"Hello, World!"`
